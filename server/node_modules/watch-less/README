watch-less is a simple command line tool that will watch a directory tree and output a compiled .css file whenever a .less file is changed.

I recomend installing globally for ease of use.

    sudo npm install -g watch-less

using it is as simple as:

    watch-less

to see various options use

    watch-less --help
